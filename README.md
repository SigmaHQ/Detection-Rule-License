# Detection-Rule-License (DRL)

The Detection Rule License (DRL) is a license for open-source detection logic as shared in, e.g. YARA, Sigma, or Snort rules.

It is very permissive and allows the private and commercial use of the detection logic *as long as the rule's author is mentioned in the reproduction of the rules and an output showing matches with the licensed rule*.

One could also say: *"You can do anything with the rule as long as you give credit to the author."*

The attribution is also required when showing matches with the detection rules licensed under the DRL. Vendors using a rule licensed under DRL must include the author in views that show matches. (e.g., in a separate field or column)
